# web-hooks development

## Implementation

The `web-hooks` package is implemented by a single [web-hooks.ts](./web-hooks.ts) file.
Do not edit web-hooks.d.ts nor web-hooks.js, they are generated by `npm run build`.

## Documentation

Examples and documentation are deployed on GitHub Pages here: https://fibo.github.io/web-hooks

To update them, push to the `gh-pages` branch, do something like

```sh
git branch
* main

git switch gh-pages
git rebase main
git push origin gh-pages
```
